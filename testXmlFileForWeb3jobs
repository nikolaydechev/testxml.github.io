    <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Akuna:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akuna Capital is an innovative trading firm with a strong focus on collaboration, cutting-edge technology, data driven solutions and automation. We specialise in providing liquidity as an options market maker – meaning we are committed to providing competitive quotes that we are willing to both buy and sell. To do this successfully we design and implement our own low latency technologies, trading strategies and mathematical models. At Akuna we have a flat structure, where the best idea wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Founding Partners, including our CEO Andrew Killion, first conceptualised Akuna in their hometown of Sydney. They opened our first office in 2011 in Chicago, the heart of the derivatives &amp;amp; options industry. &amp;nbsp;Akuna then expanded to Sydney in 2018 to be the centre of our Asian trading operations, and in 2021 moved to our new Barangaroo waterfront office.&amp;nbsp;We are currently trading HK, Korea, cryptocurrencies and US night markets and are excited for expansions into all the major Asian exchanges.&amp;nbsp;We also have offices in Shanghai and Boston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Akuna, we believe that the people are the centre of everything we do. Our Sydney office has a start-up feel with less than 200 people, which means you really get to know the team! We run social poker competitions, office happy hours, have a fully stacked breakfast and snack room, host social events, go on company trips, have social clubs, and offer great training with our Akuna University. We are expanding rapidly and looking for the best talent to join us on this journey. If you enjoy being part of smart, driven teams with real challenges to solve- this could be the place for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you&#39;ll do as a Systems Engineer at Akuna:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking for a Systems Engineer to be responsible for Akuna’s Linux server platform health. This person will participate in the design, deployment, and maintenance of our high-performance platform to support our trading environment. They will also automate daily software and hardware tasks while writing and maintaining scripts and tools.&amp;nbsp;The ideal candidate will be self-motivated, proactive, and able to take ownership of projects and problems&amp;nbsp;with minimal supervision. In this role, you will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage Akuna’s Linux server infrastructure at domestic and global data centers&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Provide additional day-to-day support including system analysis, monitoring, and performance tuning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualities that make great candidates:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why BlockFi?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;BlockFi has experienced incredible growth since our launch in August 2017. Our client base has grown to more than 225,000 (and counting), and the company now boasts more than $15 billion in assets on our platform. We recently completed a Series D funding round placing the company&#39;s valuation at $3 billion, and our team now has more than 500 people worldwide. We have established ourselves as a crypto market leader, and as we expand our product suite and geographic footprint, we expect our addressable market to grow exponentially.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empower the Individual Through Crypto&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Gemini is a crypto exchange and custodian that allows customers to buy, sell, store, and earn more than 30 cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether, litecoin, and Zcash. Gemini is a New York trust company that is subject to the capital reserve requirements, cybersecurity requirements, and banking compliance standards set forth by the New York State Department of Financial Services and the New York Banking Law. Gemini was founded in 2014 by twin brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss to empower the individual through crypto.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Crypto is about giving you greater choice, independence, and opportunity. We are here to help you on your journey. We build crypto products that are simple, elegant, and secure. Whether you are an individual or an institution, we want to help you buy, sell, and store your bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Crypto is not just a technology, it&#39;s a movement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;At Gemini, our mission is to &lt;strong&gt;empower the individual&lt;/strong&gt; and that includes giving our employees flexibility of choice — our Office Optional Policy allows employees to choose to work from one of our physical locations or from home.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Department: Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is central to all of our business functions and drive many of our most important decisions at Gemini. As a result, the analysts, scientists, and engineers that make up the Data team are uniquely positioned to advise and influence cross-functional projects. These projects cover a wide-range of topics including product strategy, user acquisition and journey, cryptocurrency performance and project development, and crypto’s position as a technology, industry, and asset class within the context of the global financial markets at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Role: Manager, Data Engineering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the leader, you&#39;ll shape the way we approach data at Gemini by creating a strategic vision for how data can help drive our business growth. You will build and manage a high-performance data engineering team and leverage your data experience and communication skills to work across business teams to develop innovative data solutions. You will inspire and mentor a strong data team through your passion for data and its ability to transform decision-making and generate solutions for this new, exciting asset class. Communicating your insights and driving new product development across the organization is paramount to success. You will also be looked upon to share Gemini&#39;s data vision and products externally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This role will be based in Gemini&#39;s Singapore office.&lt;/p&gt;

    <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parity’s Polkadot&lt;/strong&gt; blockchain implementation has seen &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;107 releases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; so far. On top of that the list of our releasable artifacts ranges from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/paritytech/parity-signer&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;mobile apps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/paritytech/banana_split&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;html-based offline desktop apps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; (yes, this is a thing).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Parity is looking for an industrious Release Automation Engineer to help us stay on top of that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;rather extensive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; release roadmap, and adhering to our rather rigorous security standards while doing so. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;(Yes, there are cleanroom builds. Yes, those happen on dedicated hardware in our physical possession.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;You will be taking our freshest codebases and turning them into shiny &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;signature-wrapped&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; binaries ready for the final QA round and publishing — then upload the result to appropriate locations, updating release notes and posting the announcements. And hopefully you won’t be doing this by hand, no — but automatedly, with style.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We expect that you :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;have a prior exposure to any reasonable &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;build system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; (ideally this would be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;cargo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, since we’re a Rust shop — but &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;make&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; will do).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;are fluent in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bash&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; — but bonus points if your weapon of choice is some other, more sane scripting language.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;are familiar with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;desktop software packaging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; — ideally finding certain comfort in maintaining old-school &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;deb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;rpm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; repos in the modern world of red-green deployments and html5-based webapps.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;have seen enough &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linux internals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; to reason about choice of the libc version to link our software with.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;can figure out how to build software for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mac&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; if necessary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;can show us some advanced &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPG&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; trickery. (Yes, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;GPG is considered harmful&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. But it’s inevitable evil when it comes to release signing; you &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;*will*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; be exposed. Let’s say it’s an occupational hazard.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;know how to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Docker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; your way around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;are able to maintain &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;security&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; of our build systems and supply chains, knowing that there are threats out there who are advanced, persistent and are after us in particular.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;are a kind of person who finds The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Checklist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; Manifesto book by Atul Gawande really inspiring.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;You might get some extra points for your prior work on FOSS software and experience with blockchain systems — but not much else matters; definitely not your gender or nationality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a completely remote role and must be located in the United States.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;RECUR is building the future of digital collectibles on-chain, known as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) – the newest Unicorn industry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Global brands are interested in venturing into NFTs to establish new connections with their fans. However, they are very careful about who they work with, especially in the cutting-edge world of blockchain. RECUR is founded by the perfect blend of leaders in the brand licensing space and technology leaders from top cryptocurrency exchanges, digital asset trading desks, financial institutions, and blockchain software companies. Investors include Joseph Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum, Winklevoss Twins, Courtside VC, Hashed, and many more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;RECUR is seeking a KYC Associate to join its team full-time. This is an exciting opportunity to join a fast-growing team, where you will support RECUR’s global user base, ensuring safety on the platform as customers interact with some of the largest brands in the world entering the nascent and growing NFT space.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you will do at RECUR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In this role, you are responsible for maintaining and owning RECUR’s Know Your Customer (KYC) program, which includes manually reviewing identification queues, requesting KYC from customers when needed, updating operating procedures as needed, and assessing the effectiveness of our KYC vendors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Enhance our KYC systems by working with our KYC vendors and with in-house engineers to optimize and automate KYC processes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Contribute to communications with customers about KYC, including the purpose and benefits of KYC as well as best practices to successfully KYC.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Identify, escalate, and work to resolve any issues or gaps within our KYC systems and processes and, documenting such escalations appropriately.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Ensure all KYC operating procedures documentation is constantly updated and accurate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Oversee and make recommendations concerning RECUR’s KYC vendors as we expand our global customer base.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Design and implement Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) processes, and communicate with customers when additional information is needed for EDD purposes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Contribute to developing metrics (OKRs and KPIs) related to our KYC systems and workflows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Foster a culture of compliance, and be a strong contributor to RECUR’s Compliance team, helping to build and maintain a compliance program that effectively navigates the complex and evolving regulations to protect RECUR customers and the RECUR ecosystem.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Collaborate with a broad array of cross-functional teams that support, manage, and grow RECUR, such as engineering, customer support, as well as business and product teams.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Continuously develop your understanding and approach to mitigating risk to best protect RECUR users and the RECUR ecosystem.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you bring to RECUR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Our mission is to enable budget-conscious consumers to earn additional income from their everyday habits. We accomplish this with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.current.android&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; an Android app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://modephone.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; smartphone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; that pay users to listen to music, charge their phone, play games, complete surveys; and connect them with exclusive deals to save and earn even more.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Current Mobile is a fully remote US-based company that builds mobile technology products for budget-conscious consumers. Our products let people around the world earn passive income while using their mobile phones for daily habits like music, games, news, shopping, browsing, charging, and even unlocking their devices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We continue to expand our product offering to more than 3 million monthly active users and pace towards revenue growth of more than 400% in 2021. Additionally, we expect to have paid out $6+ million to earners this year and look forward to strong continued growth ahead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In 2018, Current became the first company to raise over $36M through an SEC-registered security token offering, to implement our royalty-paying token $CRNC across company product lines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Current Mobile?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;You have an opportunity to join a team of high-caliber ambitious people who are out to challenge the status quo of content consumption.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We’re a well-funded revenue-generating company, and have a runway for years to come.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We are rapidly growing and as we embark on the next phase of our incredible expansion, we are looking for exceptional talent to help fuel the growth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We’re committed to bringing diverse industry experiences and perspectives together. The team is made up of alumni from Y-Combinator, Ivy League Universities, College Dropouts, Fortune 500, and everything in between.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We have superior financiers and advisors including Mark Cuban and several top-tier institutional investors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We care about building a disruptive product that empowers our users. We think big!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About The Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We&#39;d love to talk with you if…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;You have a minimum 10 years of related experience in digital marketing and advertising, preferably in a fast-paced environment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Experience with social, display, search, native, content, and affiliate marketing is a must.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;You have a strong analytical, mathematical mindset and experience with web analytics. You know how to build logical interconnections using data and communicate within the company.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Experience with tagging, URL parameters, conversion pixels, and S2S postbacks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Experience with analytic platforms like Google Analytics and Mixpanel with ability to take a deep dive extracting valuable and actionable data sets&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;You have the ability to influence cross-functional teams without formal authority.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Experience working with media buying agencies&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Experience with giveaway or sweepstakes strategy’s and websites is a major plus&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;App advertising is a plus with experience working with MMPs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role Expectations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;You&#39;ll be working closely with the leadership team and reporting directly to the VP of Marketing, and will be responsible for a wide range of tasks, including:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Driving users through several marketing channels including but not limited to Facebook, Google, Taboola, Outbrain, TikTok, DSPs, etc. to blog pages with affiliate offers and Current Rewards app ensuring Media Efficiency Ratio goals are met&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Reporting on key metrics weekly from media channels and affiliate partners/networks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A/B testing copy, images, layout on the blog site, optimizing towards revenue and engagement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Setup proper tracking methods ensuring we can track users from impression, to click, to conversion, and ultimately revenue.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Update landing pages with new converting content.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Work with the creative team on ads weekly testing images, headlines, descriptions, etc.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Hire additional team members as Current’s marketing effort expands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We All Share The Same Core Values&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead with Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; - Leadership does not necessarily mean management. Everyone is a leader, no matter the role. Taking pride in your responsibilities, finding &amp;amp; executing solutions is key.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on the ‘Why’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;- The best solutions start with everyone understanding the problem and its impact. We’ve found that if someone understands the ‘why’, they will produce an innovative &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘what’ and ‘how’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. If we cannot explain the ‘why’ clearly, we don’t understand the problem ourselves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bring a Sense of Humor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; - Our work environment is a lighthearted &amp;amp; positive place where employees are united by humor and camaraderie; we believe laughter is a great way to uplift employee morale and form bonds with each other.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set New Precedents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; - We drive innovation and push boundaries for all company activities while understanding that anything worth doing will have roadblocks. We set a new standard of worth for people’s time, data, and attention while rewarding what most other companies take.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; - We won’t thrive without recognizing others’ strengths. Listen and evolve together, helping and supporting each other for the sake of a collective goal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We Believe In The Following Workplace Norms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

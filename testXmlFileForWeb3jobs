    <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Akuna:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akuna Capital is an innovative trading firm with a strong focus on collaboration, cutting-edge technology, data driven solutions and automation. We specialise in providing liquidity as an options market maker – meaning we are committed to providing competitive quotes that we are willing to both buy and sell. To do this successfully we design and implement our own low latency technologies, trading strategies and mathematical models. At Akuna we have a flat structure, where the best idea wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Founding Partners, including our CEO Andrew Killion, first conceptualised Akuna in their hometown of Sydney. They opened our first office in 2011 in Chicago, the heart of the derivatives &amp;amp; options industry. &amp;nbsp;Akuna then expanded to Sydney in 2018 to be the centre of our Asian trading operations, and in 2021 moved to our new Barangaroo waterfront office.&amp;nbsp;We are currently trading HK, Korea, cryptocurrencies and US night markets and are excited for expansions into all the major Asian exchanges.&amp;nbsp;We also have offices in Shanghai and Boston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Akuna, we believe that the people are the centre of everything we do. Our Sydney office has a start-up feel with less than 200 people, which means you really get to know the team! We run social poker competitions, office happy hours, have a fully stacked breakfast and snack room, host social events, go on company trips, have social clubs, and offer great training with our Akuna University. We are expanding rapidly and looking for the best talent to join us on this journey. If you enjoy being part of smart, driven teams with real challenges to solve- this could be the place for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you&#39;ll do as a Systems Engineer at Akuna:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking for a Systems Engineer to be responsible for Akuna’s Linux server platform health. This person will participate in the design, deployment, and maintenance of our high-performance platform to support our trading environment. They will also automate daily software and hardware tasks while writing and maintaining scripts and tools.&amp;nbsp;The ideal candidate will be self-motivated, proactive, and able to take ownership of projects and problems&amp;nbsp;with minimal supervision. In this role, you will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage Akuna’s Linux server infrastructure at domestic and global data centers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be responsible for trading system server operations&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Provide additional day-to-day support including system analysis, monitoring, and performance tuning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualities that make great candidates:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of database systems, including PostgreSQL and MySQL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in troubleshooting multicast and TCP related performance issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to diagnose and troubleshoot issues&lt;/li&gt;

We help millions of people buy and sell bitcoin, and over 30 other crypto assets every day — but our work is a whole lot more than that. We’re building an inclusive future of finance, one that opens new opportunities to learn financial literacy, store value, and build wealth for everyone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Ready to help the next billion people experience the future of finance with us? Come on board.

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Cardano is an open source blockchain project, committed to a roadmap towards decentralized governance. As part of this journey, IO Global is looking for a Project Manager to help drive forward our Decentralized Consortium Funding program, an exciting new model to expand the developer base for Cardano’s protocol and ecosystem development.  </p> <p>In 2021, Cardano has achieved incredible success, but we are still early in this space and have a long way to go.  A big component of the continued evolution of Cardano is IOG’s efforts to fully open source and decentralize the core development of the platform and protocol.  To do this, we will need to build a broad coalition and a consortium of highly qualified and reputable firms that can meaningfully contribute to this effort.  </p> <p>As a Project Manager at IOG, you are responsible for creating, maintaining, and assessing the project plans, working directly with the Cardano DCF delivery team to ensure adherence to timelines, monitor slippage, and escalate issues and risks.

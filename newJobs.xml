First off, we love our community (Yat🤝our community). We have a passionate group of creators who pour their time and energy into using Yats as a vehicle for self-expression (think of it as hieroglyphics for the modern age). They create emoji internet identities that they can use across every chat app, social network, metaverse (and beyond), and that we consider beautiful works of art with profound messages.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 11pt">It’s really about connecting to the universal language of visual representation in a whole new way, one that celebrates individuals, community, and everyone’s right to privacy in the digital realm. We don’t want to say we’re changing the world, but yeah, we are.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-size: 11pt">We also happen to be one of the fastest-growing consumer products of all time (👑 us) and as such needs an incredibly talented team dedicated to making sure it’s continued 🚀from here on out.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-size: 11pt">Now for a bit of background. Yat is the brainchild of Tari Labs, a digital assets-focused blockchain organization that believes privacy on the internet should be pervasive and available to all, co-founded by Naveen Jain (who also founded Sparkart). And in case you’re worried about funding (stability), Yat is backed by Blockchain Capital, Pantera Capital, Multicoin Capital, Trinity Ventures, Redpoint Ventures, Canaan Partners, and Slow Ventures (as well as some of the best investors in the world).</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-size: 11pt">And who are you? Well, we’re hoping you’re someone who takes the exceptional and exceeds it, who rolls up their sleeves and gets their hands dirty, and who wants to take a step outside the ordinary to create a world that’s more beautiful, fun, and privacy-oriented. </span></div><div><br></div><div>We’re looking for a Senior Product Designer to help Yat Labs design the future of emoji identities. You’ll collaborate with other designers, design-oriented engineers, and product managers. You will be a core part of a small team that designs new features for Yat, from proposing initial concepts to helping ship high-quality features. You will be contributing to all aspects of product design and execution, including (visual design, interaction design, and prototyping). We look for problem solvers and great designers that can deliver beautiful visuals and are not afraid to take risks.&nbsp;</div><br/>About You:<br/><li>You care deeply about communication, teamwork, and craftsmanship.</li><li>You proactively bring people together to solve problems.</li><li>You’re an excellent product storyteller.</li><li>You are a systems-thinker and are able to extrapolate and extend shared patterns and behaviors.</li><li>You’re a pro collaborator, facilitator and communicator.&nbsp;</li><li>You love personal growth as much as you live, eat and breathe product design.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>You care about details and are excited to keep pushing your work until it is pixel-perfect.</li><li>Can reduce complex problems down to the right balance of flexibility, power, and ease of use</li><li>Intrigued by the prospect of working at a consumer startup that’s at the intersection of digital identity, emojis, privacy, the creator economy, and NFTs, and is led by a founding team with significant prior success and deep industry credibility.</li><br/>What You'll Do:<br/><li>Support design projects across the entire product lifecycle for both mobile, web, and desktop platforms and from wireframes to hi-fi prototypes.</li><li>Be autonomous. You’ll take full ownership of your work, and you take responsibility for every last detail, every step of the way.</li><li>Rapidly produce multiple concepts and prototypes; knowing when to apply pixel-perfect attention to detail, and when to make low-fi sketches and prototypes.</li><li>Understand our users through exploratory research.</li><li>Help develop an overarching design system to aid rapid development and iteration.</li><li>Solicit feedback from other designers in order to continually raise our bar for quality.</li><li>Support contributions from external contributors.</li><li>Extend existing visual styles and design patterns to new components and features.&nbsp;</li><br/>Requirements:<br/><li>3+ years experience&nbsp;</li><li>A compelling portfolio of work that demonstrates high-quality design work that also tells a story that you are a deep design thinker.</li><li>Great written and verbal communication skills with experience collaborating with product and engineering teams to make product visions come to life.</li><li>A skilled storyteller and ‘conceptor’, with experience working in a multidisciplinary environment to develop concepts that delight customers and deliver business results</li><li>Understanding and application of user-centered design methods and principles.</li><li>Ability to deeply empathize with different kinds of users.</li><li>Basic HTML/CSS &amp; Javascript knowledge; current on latest responsive design techniques</li><li>Experience running and consuming UX research&nbsp;</li><li>Experience with branding and marketing&nbsp;</li><br/>Benefits:<br/><li>100% Remote</li><li>Highly competitive compensation package</li><li>Comprehensive benefits, including up to 100% paid medical, dental, &amp; vision insurance coverage for you &amp; your loved one.</li><li>401k program&nbsp;</li><li>An Oculus Quest 2 - Our All Hands meetings and Engagement events are done in VR</li><li>Flexible work schedule and paid time to create your own work/life harmony</li><li>An international team of highly talented and engaged people from different cultural backgrounds and locations.</li><li>The latest technology and equipment to do your best work from your home office</li><li>Be an OG in a young project that is already making 🌊</li><div><span style="font-size: 11pt">That's all to say: these job listings are approximations!

We’re experts on the “why” and the “how” with deep relationships and knowledge of navigating government sales processes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Account Executives are servant leaders who can quickly establish trust and build strong relationships with the Public Sector stakeholders, tailoring their sales approach to their needs, and evangelizing Chainalysis solutions in a compelling yet approachable way.

They are experts at navigating complex sales cycles. and still enjoy the thrill creating a calculated account plan and then closing a deal. We measure your success by your ability to accurately forecast revenue and hit (read: exceed) quotas and the engagement of your team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In one year you’ll know you were successful if…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

You&#39;re an Excel whiz, and ideally have worked with business intelligence software and SQL, too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re entrepreneurial.&lt;/strong&gt; You’ll have (often ambiguous) responsibilities ranging from product, to project management, to operations. While CoinList has an autonomous and flat culture where anyone can propose new initiatives, it is also a low ego environment where you shouldn’t be opposed to getting your hands dirty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re organized&lt;/strong&gt;. You’ll be working with our Sales and Business Operations teams as well as directly with token issuers (sometimes multiple at once) and managing complex projects with many moving parts. You make deadlines for yourself and move fast. You focus on the things that matter and aren’t afraid to have hard conversations internally and externally. Your team trusts you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re curious.&lt;/strong&gt; You want to understand how things work and like to question things, and can synthesize the ideas concisely. You learn quickly and like picking up new skills like SQL, and HTML on the fly. You aren’t intimidated by complex problems and enjoy solving them. There will be resources to support you, but you dictate your growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What you will do:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help make the best teams in crypto successful.&lt;/strong&gt; CoinList has helped companies like Immutable X, Braintrust, and Filecoin raise funds and build their communities. You’ll work closely with our Sales and Business Operations teams to support them during token sales, token distributions, and leverage internal resources across legal, compliance, and accounting to make sure they’re successful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve internal decision making.&lt;/strong&gt; You will analyze large amounts of data and make actionable recommendations based on it, building dashboards and helping people across the company leverage our data. Your work will directly improve decision making for our CEO and across the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support and build our sales pipeline.&lt;/strong&gt; You will intimately understand our token sales pipeline and help define future KPIs for sales initiatives as well as identify new industry opportunities for CoinList to capitalize on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scale our operations.&lt;/strong&gt; You will design processes to help us systematically run token sales and other initiatives, balancing that against a steady stream of ad-hoc operations requests and interesting problems that need solving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be a founder.&lt;/strong&gt; As an early part of our core team, you will take it upon yourself to identify opportunities for CoinList, get buy-in internally, and execute. CoinList is an incredibly entrepreneurial environment and we want people who will take advantage of this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an early employee at CoinList, you will be a critical part of our core team and have a huge influence over the direction of the company. We will compensate you well, invest deeply in your development, and do everything we can to make sure this is the single best work experience of your life. At CoinList, we are proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer. We celebrate diversity, value our differences, and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Qualification and Skills&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Excellent interpersonal, verbal, and written communication skills, including the ability to speak to business development and technical teams internally and externally.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Working at Parity means focusing on the stuff that counts: building the most cutting-edge technology for the future web. Our teams enjoy a high degree of trust, freedom and autonomy to achieve that goal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Not all of us who collaborate work in the same place. Bringing the team together is something we value a lot, so we regularly go on team retreats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    <description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empower the Individual Through Crypto&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Gemini is a crypto exchange and custodian that allows customers to buy, sell, store, and earn more than 30 cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether, litecoin, and Zcash. Gemini is a New York trust company that is subject to the capital reserve requirements, cybersecurity requirements, and banking compliance standards set forth by the New York State Department of Financial Services and the New York Banking Law. Gemini was founded in 2014 by twin brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss to empower the individual through crypto.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Crypto is about giving you greater choice, independence, and opportunity. We are here to help you on your journey. We build crypto products that are simple, elegant, and secure. Whether you are an individual or an institution, we want to help you buy, sell, and store your bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Crypto is not just a technology, it&#39;s a movement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;At Gemini, our mission is to &lt;strong&gt;empower the individual&lt;/strong&gt; and that includes giving our employees flexibility of choice — our Office Optional Policy allows employees to choose to work from one of our physical locations or from home.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Select roles that are location-specific will still be eligible for flexible schedules.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Department: &lt;/strong&gt;Data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is central to all of our business functions and drive many of our most important decisions at Gemini. As a result, the analysts, scientists, and engineers that make up the Data team are uniquely positioned to advise and influence cross-functional projects. These projects cover a wide-range of topics including product strategy, user acquisition and journey, cryptocurrency performance and project development, and crypto’s position as a technology, industry, and asset class within the context of the global financial markets at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Role: &lt;/strong&gt;Senior Data Analytics Engineer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;p-rich_text_section&quot;&gt;As a member of our data engineering team, you’ll shape the way we approach data at Gemini by using your engineering, analytical and communication skills to work with teams across the business. You know how to ask the right questions and are passionate about using data to support and drive informed business decisions. You are ready to roll up your sleeves and are excited to take on challenging opportunities and projects. You’ll work with data engineers and analysts and guide our internal teams to use data to improve the product and achieve KPIs.

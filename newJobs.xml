&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Paxful is the people-powered marketplace for money transfers with anyone, anywhere, at any time. Imagine a world where everyone has equal access to finance, no matter who they are, or where they’re from. We&#39;re building it. Our mission is to empower the forgotten four billion unbanked, so they have control of their money in a way they&#39;ve never had before.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Working across three offices in different time zones, the Paxful team serves our amazing community of 4 million strong. We build for people, not profits, and consider ourselves to be everyday heroes who don’t wear capes or masks. That’s why we launched Built with Bitcoin, a charitable initiative that aims to build 100 schools, water facilities, and entrepreneurial incubators in emerging markets all over the world. We want to show that bitcoin can have a positive impact and make real changes in the lives of people everywhere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Paxful is searching for an Associate, CCX-Training/Knowledge Management who is great at building relationships with team members, communicating with stakeholders, coordinating personnel, documenting procedures, advocating and consulting on behalf of and with the Customer Experience team, and owning the work assigned for it to evolve enough&amp;nbsp; to join our Customer Experience Team.&amp;nbsp; This role will provide a dedicated individual to keep Customer Experience informed and up to date by owning Training’s Support Readiness Program, as well as internal content documentation. You will be based out of The United States and report to our Manager, CCX- Training and Quality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Build relationships with stakeholders and beyond to maintain, grow, and create channels of communication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Communicate with stakeholders and beyond regarding product changes and their impact on CX and customers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Coordinate readiness efforts to ensure that CX is prepared with all necessary provisions ahead of time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Own the work. Support Readiness is a program with structure and foundation and work-flows, but needs an owner to continually evolve and improve them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
